# [Boilerstrap](http://getboilerstrap.com)

Boilerstrap is a Wordpress Theme based on the Twenty Twelve theme by the WordPress team with Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Keypress.js, custom web fonts, and much more added.

## Getting Started with Boilerstrap

There are a few different ways you can use Boilerstrap: as a WordPress theme for your website, as a base to build your own custom WordPress theme, or as a framework to build a fully customized website or web application using Bootstrap.

## As a WordPress theme for your website

Currently Boilerstrap is not in the Wordpress extensions database so in order to use it on your website you'll need to download it to your computer and upload it to your website.

**1)** Download the latest version of the theme from Github: [http://getboilerstrap.com/latest.zip](http://getboilerstrap.com/latest.zip)
 
**2)** Upload the theme to WordPress from the admin control panel using these instructions: [Adding New Themes (The WordPress Codex)](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Adding_New_Themes)

**4)** Activate the theme in your WordPress admin control panel.

## As a framework to build your own custom WordPress theme

Boilerstrap is a minimalist WordPress theme based on the Twenty Twelve theme with Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Keypress.js, and more fully integrated. Boilerstrap helps save you time by coming with the support you want out of the box so you can focus on styling it how you want it and building your site, not worrying about making sure Bootstrap gets added to your theme. You can use Bootstrap classes anywhere in your layout (scaffolding), for presentation (buttons, labels, badges, headings, etc) and for interactivity (tabs, toggles, carousel, alerts, etc.) We've designed the site to be easy to customize while still being possible to keep up to date using Git. We aren't in the WordPress theme database yet, so for now you'll need to keep your core theme files up to date using Git.

**1)** Download the latest version of the theme from Github: [http://getboilerstrap.com/latest.zip](http://getboilerstrap.com/latest.zip)

**2)** Upload the theme to WordPress from the admin control panel using these instructions: [Adding New Themes (The WordPress Codex)](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Adding_New_Themes)

**4)** Activate the theme in your WordPress admin control panel.

**5)** Add your site-specific CSS to `css/custom.css`, which is included in the `.gitignore` file and won't be overwritten when you update Git

**6)** Site-specific code goes in `js/boilerstrap.js`

## As an easy way to build fully custom Bootstrap websites

**1)** Download the latest version of the theme from Github: [http://getboilerstrap.com/latest.zip](http://getboilerstrap.com/latest.zip)

**2)** Upload the theme to WordPress from the admin control panel using these instructions: [Adding New Themes (The WordPress Codex)](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Adding_New_Themes)

**4)** Activate the theme in your WordPress admin control panel.

**5)** Install the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin for WordPress which allows you to build very versatile layouts using custom fields applied to posts and pages using easy to configure logic.

**6)** Design a custom page template for each page you want in your website or application and store them in the `page-templates/` folder. You can use Bootstrap's CSS classes and Javascript plugins in the design of your page templates. Put all your custom JavaScript in `js/boilerstrap.js`. Tooltips and Popovers have already been initiated.

**7)** Use the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to build a set of input fields for each page or post-type you need on your site.

**8)** Now when the users update WordPress they will update each page specifically with the content they want to put on that layout specifically.

This is an easy way to quickly build a Bootstrap-powered website using WordPress as a content management system which is a great platform for a variety of wonderful plugins, and has advantages like site search, user-logins, and automatically-generated content feeds.
